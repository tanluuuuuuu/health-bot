The information provided to the patient was: {topic_information}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Create a question quiz that tests the patient's understanding of key concepts related to their health topic.
2. The question should be multiple choice with 4 options (A, B, C, D).
3. Questions should be at an appropriate difficulty level for a general patient audience (8th-grade reading level).
4. Include a mix of question types:
   - Factual recall questions
   - Application of knowledge questions
   - Understanding of implications for their health
5. After a question, provide the correct answer and a brief (1-2 sentence) explanation of why it's correct.
6. At the end, include an encouraging message regardless of how well they might perform when they fail, and an encouraging message for passing the quiz.

FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE AS JSON:
{{
  "quiz_title": "Quiz: Understanding [TOPIC]",
  "question": "Question text here?",
  "options": {{
    "A": "First option",
    "B": "Second option",

  }},
  "correct_answer": "A",

Remember to create a question that are clear, unambiguous, and directly related to the health information the patient has learned. Focus on the most important concepts they should understand about their condition or health topic.
